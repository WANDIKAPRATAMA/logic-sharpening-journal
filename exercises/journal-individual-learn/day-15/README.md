# Kata: Best Buy/Sell Profit

## Description

You are a buyer/seller, and your business is at stake. Your goal is to maximize profit or, at the very least, minimize losses. Given a list of prices representing the evolution of buy/sell operations over time, you need to select two prices: one for buying and one for selling. The buying price must come before the selling price in the list.

Your task is to find the maximum profit you can achieve.

## Example

Given an array of prices: 

\[3, 10, 8, 4\]

The best profit you could make would be 7, as you would buy at 3 and then sell at 10.

## Input

- A list of prices (integers) with a length of 2 or more.

## Output

- The result of the best buy/sell operation, represented as an integer.

## Note

- Be aware that you may encounter lists with several thousand elements, so consider performance when implementing your solution.
