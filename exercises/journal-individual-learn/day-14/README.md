# Kata: Sort Inner Content of Words

## Description

You need to sort the inner content of every word in a given string in descending order. The "inner content" refers to the characters of a word excluding the first and last characters.

## Examples

- Input: `"sort the inner content in descending order"`  
  Output: `"srot the inner ctonnet in dsnnieedcg oredr"`

- Input: `"wait for me"`  
  Output: `"wiat for me"`

- Input: `"this kata is easy"`  
  Output: `"tihs ktaa is esay"`

## Constraints

- Words are composed of lowercase letters only.
- The input string will never be null or empty.
- In C/C++, the string is always null-terminated.

## Instructions

Have fun coding this kata! If you enjoyed it, please don't forget to vote and rank it!

Additionally, I have created other katas. Feel free to check them out!
