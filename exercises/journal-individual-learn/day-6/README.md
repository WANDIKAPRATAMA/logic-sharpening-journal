Hereâ€™s a revised version of the README for clarity and conciseness:

**Description**

In this kata, you are given an input string, and your task is to determine whether it is a valid message. A valid message is defined by the following criteria:

1. The string should be split into segments of numbers and corresponding substrings.
2. Each number must match the length of the substring that follows it.

For example, in the string "3hey5hello2hi", it can be split into segments: 3, hey, 5, hello, 2, hi. The function should return `true` because:

- "hey" has 3 characters,
- "hello" has 5 characters,
- "hi" has 2 characters.

Since the numbers match the character counts of their respective substrings, the result is `true`.

**Notes:**

- Messages consist only of letters and digits.
- Numbers may have multiple digits (e.g., "4code13hellocodewars" is a valid message).
- Every number must correspond to the length of the following substring; otherwise, the message is invalid (e.g., "hello5" and "2hi2" are invalid).
- An empty string should return `true`.
