## Abbreviation of Words in a String

The term **i18n** is a common abbreviation for **internationalization** in the developer community, used to avoid typing the entire word and to prevent spelling errors. Similarly, **a11y** is an abbreviation for **accessibility**.

### Task

Write a function that takes a string and converts any "words" (defined below) of length 4 or greater into an abbreviation, following these rules:

- A "word" is defined as a sequence of alphabetical characters. Any other character, such as a space or hyphen (e.g., "elephant-ride"), will split a series of letters into separate words (e.g., "elephant" and "ride").
- The abbreviated version of a word should consist of the first letter, followed by the number of removed characters, and then the last letter. For example, "elephant ride" becomes "e6t r2e".

### Example

**Input:**

```
"elephant-rides are really fun!"
```

**Word Breakdown:**

- Words: "elephant", "rides", "are", "really", "fun"
- Lengths: 123456, 123, 1, 1234, 1
- Ignore short words: "are" and "fun"

**Abbreviated Words:**

- "elephant" → "e6t"
- "rides" → "r3s"
- "are" → "are" (not abbreviated)
- "really" → "r4y"
- "fun" → "fun" (not abbreviated)

**Output:**

```
"e6t-r3s are r4y fun!"

```

This function uses a regular expression to find words and applies the abbreviation rules as specified. Non-word characters remain in their original positions.
